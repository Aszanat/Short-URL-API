# Short-URL-API
### Recruitment task - backend developer
Create a project "API in DRF for shortening urls" - something like URL Shortener, Branded
Short Links & Analytics | TinyURL, but just the API.

The project should allow you to:

ğŸ‘‰ create a shortened urls, that is, for example, you put
`http://example.com/very-very/long/url/even-longer` and in return you get a short url generated by the API, such as `http://localhost:8000/shrt/%5C%60`

ğŸ‘‰ expansion of the shortened url to the original one, which is the inverse of the previous
operation.

### How to use this?
Below I describe Linux workflow for running this project, any search engine should be able to find you a Windows or Mac equivalents. Feeling incapable? Try Chat GPT!

**Wake me up:**
> python -m venv env
>
> source env/bin/activate

**Before you go-go:**
> pip install -r requirements.txt
>
> cd url_api
>
> python manage.py runserver

*This is when you can use API at (given by django app itself) address, most likely: http://127.0.0.1:8000/*

*"Wait, it's not working, what have I doneee!?"*

*It's ok, it's ok. Path "/" is not available because this is just an API, not a full page, so you probably actually want: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/*

*For creating a new short url (POST requests only): http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/create*

*This API method requires a string (aka, text in "quotes") in it's application/json body*

*For retrieving a long url from previously created short url (GET requests only): http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/find*

*This API method requires a query string (NOT in "quotes" this time): shrt=your_short_url, so you should call for example http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/find/?shrt=http://127.0.0.1:8000/shrt/12345678*
